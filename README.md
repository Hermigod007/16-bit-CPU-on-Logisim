Created an 16 Bit CPU on Logisim Software which carries out basic instructions like reading, writing, fetching information, clearing outputs/inputs and performing basic Arithmetic and logical operations.
Constructed a fully-fledged databus which consists of resistors like Accumulator, Program counter, Dataregister, Address register, Instruction register, Temporary register and the main CPU memory.
Created an Sequence Counter for well organised execution of the instructions. Created an Arithmetic and logic unit to perform basic logical operations.
Designed a Control unit Schematic which consisted of the logic of fetching of data from various registers and feeding it into the address bus which is computed by various databus register to perform an operation.
